#### _This is a portfolio about me. Current version built April 21, 2017_

#### By _**Roger Tobias**_

## Description

_The portfolio is set up to give the reader some basic information about me. But its main purpose is to display all of my current projects that have been created while at Epicodus into one location. It has a main page with my name and some basic information in it. The project page lists out what my projects have been so far, a small little note about the project, and a link to where the project is saved. The purpose of this portfolio is for showing others my projects without having to search all over for them._
